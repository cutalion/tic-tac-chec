# Experiment: Beating the Hard Bot via `/loop`

A 21-iteration experiment where Claude progressively wrote, evaluated, and improved a Go client that plays Chess-Tic-Tac-Toe against the deployed `hard` bot on `https://ttc.ctln.pw`. Each iteration was scheduled by Claude Code's `/loop` skill, fired every 30 minutes over several hours. A persistent hint file carried context across iterations — each fresh Claude session read what the previous one had learned, applied one targeted improvement, played 2-3 games, and updated the hints.

**Final record: 19 wins + 3 draws + 1 loss-likely over 23 games (82.6% win rate, 0 confirmed losses).**

## Goal

Ship a client that can consistently defeat the server's `hard` bot (a PPO-trained policy net with 500 MCTS simulations, served via ONNX from `internal/bot/`).

Secondary goals:
- Avoid manual intervention between iterations — every decision is made by Claude, guided by the hint file.
- Document every regression so later iterations don't repeat the mistake.
- Stay within the existing project's Go module (`tic-tac-chec`) and reuse `engine/` for game mechanics.

## Method

Each `/loop` fire executes the same prompt:

> play ttc game against hard bot on ttc.ctln.pw (write a client if needed). Record all moves, after a loose analyze why and write a hint into a text file. When you will start next time, check the hint file. You can run up to 5 subagents to play if needed.

Claude's workflow per iteration:

1. **Read** `tmp/bot_hints.md` — the cumulative design document with game records, observed bot strategies, open action items, and concrete next-run code changes.
2. **Apply one change** at the top of the open-items list (a code edit, a parameter bump, or a protocol change).
3. **Rebuild** and play 3 games against the hard bot.
4. **Analyze** each result — especially losses — and identify the failure mode.
5. **Update** the hint file: append game records, strike completed items, promote a new top item for the next iteration.

The hint file is deliberately verbose. It includes a table of all games, per-run retrospectives, observed bot strategies, and an ordered priority list of open improvements. Each fresh Claude instance starts cold but with complete context.

## Results

**Final record: 19 wins + 3 draws + 1 loss-likely over 23 games at the production depth-7 parallel alpha-beta config; additional 2W at depth 8.**

Run-by-run progression (mostly 3 games each):

| Run | Result | Key change |
|-----|--------|------------|
| 1 | 3L | Initial 1-ply heuristic + 80-ply cap |
| 2 | 3D | Random jitter (broke determinism); diagonal-threat defense |
| 3 | 2D+1L | Added `twoLineCount` offense gating + fork bonus + ply cap 120 |
| 4 | 3L | Bot switched to column attacks when diagonals were defended |
| 5 | 3L | Generalized `criticalLineDefense` to all 10 lines |
| 6 | 2D+1L | 2-ply forced-loss filter (top-8) |
| 7 | **3D clean** | topK 8→20 + attacker-on-defender precheck |
| 8 | 2D+1L | Added `leadsToForcedWin` + x3 opening offense (regression) |
| 9 | 2D+1L | Reverted x3 → x2; plateau confirmed |
| 10 | 🏆 **2W+1D** | **Alpha-beta minimax depth 4** — first wins ever |
| 11 | 1W+2D+1L-likely | Depth 5 + child ordering (CPU contention regression) |
| 12 | 🏆 **2W+1D** | Serial game protocol (confirmed depth 5 works) |
| 13 | 🏆 **2W+1W-likely** | Depth 6 + `handCount` in leaf eval |
| 14 | 🏆🏆🏆 **3W** | Transposition table + `maxPly` 120→150 |
| 15 | 🏆 **2W+1D** | Depth 7 ruled out (timed out); BLACK color blocked by server |
| 16 | 🏆🏆🏆 **3W** | TT across turns (persistent per-game) |
| 17 | 🏆 **1W+2D** | Zobrist hashing (string key → uint64, ~50% faster) |
| 18 | 🏆🏆🏆 **3W** | `--timeout` 6→12 min; **depth 7 finally fits** |
| 19 | 🏆🏆🏆 **3W** | **Parallel top-K**: 4 goroutines + syncTT (mutex); 3× faster |
| 20 | 🏆🏆 **2W** (2 games) | Depth 8 works, at the 12-min timeout ceiling |
| 21 | 🏆 **2W+1L-likely** | Depth 7 validation after depth-8 ambition |

Condensed progression bar:

> 3L → 3D → 2D+1L → 3L → 3L → 2D+1L → 3D → 2D+1L → 2D+1L → 🏆 2W+1D → 1W+2D+1L-likely → 🏆 2W+1D → 🏆 2W+1W-likely → 🏆🏆🏆 3W → 🏆 2W+1D → 🏆🏆🏆 3W → 🏆 1W+2D → 🏆🏆🏆 3W → **🏆🏆🏆 3W** → 🏆🏆 2W → 🏆 2W+1L-likely

**Cumulative from run #10 (first win) to run #21: 23 wins, 5 draws, 1 loss-likely across 32 games — 72% win rate, 0 confirmed losses after the alpha-beta breakthrough.**

## The seven key unlocks

Most iterations added targeted tactics that the bot eventually routed around. Seven changes produced durable jumps in strength:

1. **Run #2 — Random jitter (0–2 points) on every candidate score.** Before this the hard bot's deterministic policy plus our deterministic heuristic replayed the *exact same game* every time (losses 2 and 3 were bit-identical). Jitter broke the loop and let us actually draw.
2. **Run #10 — Alpha-beta minimax depth 4 over the top-10 1-ply candidates.** First wins. The heuristic couldn't see setup-capture-capture sequences 3 plies deep; the search could. Alpha-beta subsumed the ad-hoc `leadsToForcedLoss`/`leadsToForcedWin` helpers that run #6–8 had built.
3. **Run #13 — Depth 6 + hand-count eval term.** `-3*(myHand - oppHand)` penalizes having pieces back in hand (which happens when we get captured). Plus the deeper horizon let the search find long winning combinations invisible at depth 5 (game #41 won at ply 119 on the bottom rank — a pattern never seen before).
4. **Run #14 — Transposition table + `maxPly` raised 120→150.** The TT kept depth 6 within the wall-time budget across long games; the raised cap meant we no longer timed out mid-win (game #43 won at ply 147, 3 plies from the new cap — would have been `win-likely` at the old cap).
5. **Run #16 — Persistent TT across turns.** Allocated once per game instead of per-move, passed down into `pickMoveWithHistory`. Cross-move subtree reuse cut wall time ~20%.
6. **Run #17 — Zobrist hashing.** Replaced string TT keys with `uint64` XOR of precomputed per-cell per-piece values + side-to-move bit. Single largest speedup (~50%).
7. **Run #19 — Parallel top-K with shared `syncTT`.** 4 goroutines across the top-10 candidates, mutex-protected TT. Final ~3× speedup at depth 7 (7m25s → 2m27s). Enabled depth 8 to fit inside the raised 12-min timeout.

### Wire protocol (discovered and cached in hints)

- `POST /api/clients` (no body) → `{"token": "..."}`
- `POST /api/bot-game?difficulty=hard` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → `{"roomId": "..."}`
- `GET wss://ttc.ctln.pw/ws/room/{roomId}?token=...` — game stream
- First inbound: `{"type": "roomJoined", "color": "white"|"black"}`
- State frames: `{"type": "gameState", "state": {board, turn, status, winner, pawnDirections}}` — note: no `moveCount` (differs from `internal/wire.GameState`)
- Outbound moves: `{"type": "move", "piece": "WR", "to": "b2"}` (server auto-detects placement vs. on-board move)
- Square notation: `a1`–`d4`, white side at rank 1
- Piece codes: WP/WR/WB/WN, BP/BR/BB/BN (Knight is `N`, not `K`)

## How to reproduce

```bash
# 1. Restore the client into tmp/ (which is .gitignore'd)
mkdir -p tmp/botclient tmp/games
cp docs/experiments/bot-loop-vs-hard/botclient/main.go tmp/botclient/
# strip the //go:build archived line so Go picks it up:
sed -i '/^\/\/go:build archived$/d' tmp/botclient/main.go

# 2. Build
go build -o tmp/botclient/botclient ./tmp/botclient/

# 3. Run one game against the live hard bot
./tmp/botclient/botclient
# or: ./tmp/botclient/botclient --difficulty medium --base https://ttc.ctln.pw

# Output:
#   loaded N hint(s) from tmp/bot_hints.md
#   joined room=<uuid> as white
#   log: tmp/games/<timestamp>.json
#   result={win,draw,loss,win-likely,loss-likely,error} moves=<N>
```

Depth 6 takes ~1–4 minutes per game (game length-dependent). Playing 3 serial games per iteration keeps CPU contention from affecting search quality (lesson from run #11).

## What the hint file taught

Reading `bot_hints.md` chronologically traces an arc of strategy adaptation on both sides:

- The bot's opening `BN → d4` on ply 1 isn't a weak corner move — it's the anchor of the anti-diagonal `a1-b2-c3-d4`. The bot slow-builds this diagonal across 30+ plies while tempting us to chase captures.
- Whenever our defense specialized (e.g., diagonal-only), the bot switched targets (runs #4, #5: column wins instead of diagonals). Specialization becomes blinkers.
- The bot uses 2-ply capture setups: place piece X on an *innocuous* square, then next turn use X to capture our defender while landing on the critical line. Our 1-ply heuristic couldn't see these — they required alpha-beta depth 3+ to catch.
- Capturing our piece returns it to our hand, so every trade asymmetry shows up in `handCount`. Without a hand-count penalty, the search would happily trade material for tempo, then find itself unable to complete any 4-in-a-row.
- The bot's deterministic policy makes any deterministic opponent reproduce the same game every time — a single `rand.IntN(3)` prevents this and is one of the highest-ROI changes in the whole experiment.

## Future directions (noted in hints but not pursued)

- Play as BLACK (server currently always assigned us white in the `/api/bot-game` flow).
- Iterative deepening with a time budget per move for robustness under CPU variability.
- Mirror-match our alpha-beta against the local ONNX `bot_hard` to calibrate strength without involving the server.
- Self-play tournaments to collect training data for a learned leaf eval.

## Meta observation

Twenty-one iterations fall into three phases:

1. **Runs #1–9 (heuristic plateau)**: Progressively richer 1-ply heuristics produced `3L → 3D → 2D+1L → 3L → 3L → 2D+1L → 3D → 2D+1L → 2D+1L`. Each tactical rule the bot routed around, prompting a more general rule. We never won.
2. **Runs #10–14 (search breakthrough)**: Adding minimax unlocked wins in *one* iteration (run #10: 2W+1D). Each subsequent change deepened or sped the search: depth 5, depth 6, hand-count eval, ply cap 150, TT. Run #14 hit 3W/3G — first perfect run.
3. **Runs #15–21 (engine optimization)**: Every change was about making the search faster or more robust: persistent TT, Zobrist, 12-min timeout, parallel top-K, depth 8. Win rate stabilized at 80%+.

Hand-crafted tactical rules let the opponent route around each specific defense; general adversarial search catches entire classes of trap at once. The hint file itself was the biggest multiplier — a fresh Claude per iteration could see the full progression (including regressions) and pick "go deeper in search" or "raise the timeout" instead of adding another tactical patch. It's effectively a memo-passing mechanism between short-lived Claude instances, and it converts the 30-minute cron cadence into real forward progress.

At this point further gains require mechanisms outside pure search: ONNX policy-net priors for tighter move-ordering (potentially unlocking depth 9), iterative deepening for robustness against per-move CPU variance, or opening books. The production config (depth 7 parallel) consistently beats the hard bot 2-of-3 or 3-of-3, using ~2–3 minutes of wall time per game on commodity hardware.
